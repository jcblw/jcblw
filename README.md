> ##### There is no way to happiness - happiness is the way. - Th√≠ch Nh·∫•t H·∫°nh

### I am Jacob, 

a web developer with over a decade of experience in the field. My passion for coding and open-source technologies drives my desire to create and innovate. I believe that through technology, we have the power to increase access to new experiences and make a positive impact in the world.

At the heart of my work lies a love for nature and the beauty of the natural world. I find solace in the stillness of nature and the abstractions of code. My Github profile serves as a sanctuary for my thoughts and creations, while my blog is a platform to organize and share my ideas.

I am a software engineer at üåé [Commons](thecommons.earth), and the founder of üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è [Muj≈ç](https://getmujo.com). Join me on my journey as I strive to bring happiness and accessibility to all through the power of technology.
