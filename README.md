# üéí I'm Jacob

I was wandering for a while, but I found something that means a lot to me. I am happy coding, and I am happy not coding. I still get lost in nature, but I get lost in the abstractions of code more often. Github is a place for me to calm my thought and write down the systems that manifest themselves in my head, where my blog is a place to organize my thoughts.

I have been a web developer for over a decade. I love open source, and web technologies. My goal in life is to incread access to new experiences. This has manifested itself in many ways in my work.

My company is üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è[Muj≈ç](https://github.com/mujo-code)
